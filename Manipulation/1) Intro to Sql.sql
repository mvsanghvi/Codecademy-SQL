-- SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. 
-- SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. 
-- This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.
-- The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications. 
-- Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions. 
-- By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.
-- The statements covered in this course use SQLite Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). 
-- You can also access a glossary of all the SQL commands taught in this course.

-- 1. Let’s begin by entering a SQL command. In the code editor, type:

SELECT * FROM celebs;

-- You will run all of your SQL commands in this course by pressing the Run button at the bottom of the code editor.
